This file describes how to install Liquid War on a UNIX-like system.


To compile and install Liquid War under GNU/Linux, you need:
- gcc, make, etc. (*) : http://www.gnu.org/
- Python   (**)       : http://www.python.org/
- LaTeX    (optional) : http://www.latex-project.org/
- dvips    (optional) : http://www.radicaleye.com/dvips.html
- PDFLaTeX (optional) : http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/
- makeinfo (optional) : http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/texinfo.html
- Allegro  (***)      : http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/

(*) You need to have GNU Make installed. Others flavors of the make 
    utility might simply not work at all when compiling LW.

(**) Python is required to build the docs. You can decide not to
     build the docs so to some extent it's optional. However, if Python
     is installed, you'll need the "re", "string" and "xmllib" modules.
     They come with the standard distribution of Python 1.5 and 2.1,
     so it should not be a big problem.
    
(***) You won't be able to build Liquid War if you installed only
      the end-user version of Allegro. The full Allegro development 
      package is required, since it includes the datafile compiler "dat".
      FYI, the complete package weights about 2000Kb whereas the end-user 
      version - which won't allow you to build LW - is only about 500Kb.


Once you have all this installed, type:
$ autoconf
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install (run as root or any user who can write in /usr/local)
$ liquidwar

By default:
/usr/local/bin            contains symbolic links to the binaries
/usr/local/games          contains the binaries
/usr/local/share/games    contains the data
/usr/local/share/doc      contains the documentaion
/usr/local/share/pixmaps  contains an icon for Gnome/KDE/WMaker/etc...
/usr/local/share/man/man6 contains the man page
/usr/local/share/info     contains the info page

The ./configure script accepts options, the most usefull being IMHO:
--prefix=/my/path    : changes the default install directory
--disable-doc-xxx    : turns off the generation of doc in format 'xxx'
--enable-static      : enables static linking
--disable-target-opt : turns off optimizations such as "-march=i686"


Since release 5.3.3, binaries of Liquid War for GNU/Linux are available.
These binaries are statically linked against Allegro and glibc,
so they should run on any recent GNU/Linux box that has an X server running.
So if you spend too much time compiling LW, please consider using
one of those binaries, since they should work right away.
They are "slackware-like" packages, to install them, simply type (as root):
tar xzfP liquidwar-5.x.x.i386-pc-linux-gnu.tgz

Liquid War can theorically be build on any platform supported by Allegro.
In practice you might still encounter some problems:
- source code contains a bunch of "#ifdef UNIX" and the likes, which might
  cause errors on untested platforms.
- the Makefiles require GNU Make; for instance the standard make command 
  which comes with FreeBSD won't work, you'll need to install gmake.
- the code is designed for "little-endian" processors. Therefore you will
  probably not be able to run it on "big-endian" (MAC, Sparc,...) CPUs.
Most LW ports - including Linux and FreeBSD - have been done by contributors.
So if you've successfully - or even if you've tried to - build and run LW
on a new platform, please contact me, I'm interested 8-)
