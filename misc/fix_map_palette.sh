# Dirty hack based on Image Magick to make maps more "liquidwarmap"
# friendly. Indeed, we want for instance _all_ the black zones to
# have index 0. Using Image Magick can help achieving this.
#
# The script processes .bmp files only since processing .pcx files
# seems to wreck them up - from Gimp's point of view at least.
#
# Use this script with caution.

#for f in ../data/map/*.bmp ; do
for f in $* ; do
    f="../data/map/$f"
    echo $f
    mogrify -colors 256 $f
    #mogrify -map ../data/map/world1.bmp $f
    mogrify -map $f $f
done
