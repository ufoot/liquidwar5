============

![Liquid War 5 icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ufoot/liquidwar5/master/misc/liquidwar.png)

Liquid War is a unique multiplayer wargame. Its rules are
truely original and have been invented by Thomas Colcombet.
You control an army of liquid and have to try and eat your
opponents. A single player mode is available, but the game is
definitely designed to be multiplayer, and has network support.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ufoot/liquidwar5.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ufoot/liquidwar5/branches)

Liquid War 5 is now (at least) 20 years old. Some files probably
remained unchanged through all those years but yet, apparently,
still compile and run. Don't trust the git log for activity,
this thing used to be on [Source Forge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/liquidwar/)
and even before that it was developped without any source control system, back in 1998.

Since 2005, [Liquid War 6](https://www.gnu.org/software/liquidwar6)
has been released, trying to get a better interfaces and technology
to that program.

It happens Liquid War 5 is still the de facto best implementation
around, usually available for major Linux distros, and Windows or
Mac binaries usually work. Your mileage may vary, I'm definitely
not actively developping this, however I'm still experimenting on new
Liquid War ideas, I even have a `liquidwar7` folder somewhere on
my laptop where I'm hacking random things.

My overall advice would be to use this game and have fun with it,
but if you want to hack around, there might be better things to
do than touching this old and dusty code base. Please
[contact me](mailto:ufoot@ufoot.org) if you want to know more.
