This is the data directory for Liquid War 5. Previous versions relying
on Allegro 4.x used a .dat file. However this feature has been dropped
in Allegro 5.x. At least Allegro 5.x does not promote bundling all
data in a single file, it does have some custom filesystem abstraction
but not the batteries-included feature that Allegro 4.x exposed. As a
consequence, newer versions of Liquid War 5 just read plain files from
the filesystem. This .TXT file should not be removed, it is checked by
the program to get an idea whether the folder it is going to read is a
realistic equivalent of the former .DAT file. It is just checked for
existence.
